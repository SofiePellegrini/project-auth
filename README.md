# Project Auth API

This weeks project was group task and we were suposed to build an API with authentication. The project both consists of a backend and a frontend folder.

## The problem

We started with building our backend. We got help with how the structure should look from our lecture and we used Postman too try out our endpoints. The API is built with MongoDB and Mongoose. 

For the frontend we built the code from scratch. We used router to navigate between the login/register Component and the main Component that for a logged in user shows a countdown.
